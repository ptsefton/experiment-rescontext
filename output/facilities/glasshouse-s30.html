<h1 property="dc:title">Glasshouse facility at UWS Hawkesbury building S30</h1>

<p>Glasshouse in the S-precinct of the University of Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Campus, containing eight naturally lit and temperature-controlled compartments (3 x 5 x 3.5m, width x length x height). This glasshouse is widely used for short-term projects, often with a duration of 2-3 months. Air temperature is measured and controlled by an automated system at user-defined targets (+/- 4 degrees C) within each compartment. The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is controlled within each compartment using a system of infrared gas analyzers and carbon dioxide injectors. Supplementary lighting will be installed in 2013.

<h1>Data organisation overview</h1>
<p>There have been a large number of relatively short-duration experiments in the Glasshouse S30 facility, often with multiple nested projects within each experiment.  The file naming convention captures this hierarchy.</p>
<h1>File Naming Convention</h1>
<p>Convention: GHS30_&lt;EXPERIMENT&gt;<em>&lt;PROJECT&gt;</em>&lt;VARIABLE COLLECTION CODE&gt;<em>&lt;DATA PROCESSING&gt;</em>&lt;DATE or DATERANGE&gt;[_&lt;VERSION&gt;].&lt;filetype&gt;</p>
<p>(all terms in the filename should be upper case apart from the file ending which should be lower case)</p>
<p>GHS30: Official HIE facility code to represent data sourced from the S30 Glasshouse facility (all data from the S30 Glasshouse facility will be prefixed by use of the code 'GHS30'). See all official HIE facility codes here.</p>
<p>&lt;EXPERIMENT&gt;: The code of the experiment that this data was collected under. The experiment code is generally a broad category encompassing multiple nested projects. Details of codes and their respective experiments can be found below.</p>
<p>&lt;PROJECT&gt;: The project code under which data was collected. In Glasshouse facilities projects are a subset of experiments. Details of project codes can be found below. In the case of automated continuous data (where the data is not associated with a specific project) the project code 'AUTO' will be used</p>
<p>&lt;VARIABLE COLLECTION CODE&gt;: A collection code that represents a particular grouping of variables contained within a file. A list of variables contained within different variable collection codes can be found below (Note that a variable collection code can be different across two different experiment/projects).</p>
<p>&lt;DATA PROCESSING&gt;: The level of postprocessing operated on the data. The definitions of the different levels of postprocessing can be found below.</p>
<p>&lt;DATE or DATERANGE&gt;: The date range which a dataset covers (for automated timeseries data for example) or the single date on which a sample, for example, was taken. Note that dates are in the YYYYMMDD format (with a hyphen used to split the start and end date of a date range).</p>
<p>&lt;VERSION&gt;: An optional version number of the form _Vx. This can be utilised when a new version of a file already existing within HIEv has been updated/corrected (maintaining the same same data processing level).</p>
<p>&lt;filetype&gt;: The format of the data file. Further information about different file types can be found on the data formats page, found here.</p>
<h1>Variable Collection Codes</h1>
<p>Variable collection codes can vary in meaning across different GH30 experiments and projects. The full breakdown of variable collection codes and what they represent can be found here.</p>
<p>Data Processing Codes</p>
<p>The meanings of the different data processing codes used in Glasshouse S30 filenames are as follows: </p>
<p>R   -  Raw Data.               Data that has been directly extracted from an instrument and that has not been subjected to any data cleaning or post-processing
L1 -   Level One Data.      Data that has been cleaned and processed, but in a cursory manner. Some erroneous data may be included.
L2 -   Level Two Data.      Data that has been rigorously cleaned, processed, and checked for quality control. 
L3 -   Level Three Data.    Archive of published datasets. </p>
<p>Facility Status History</p>
<p>Details of the operating status of the Glasshouse S30 including shutdown periods etc can be found here.</p>
