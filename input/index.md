## Research context site demo

This is an experimental site to:

 * See how viable it is to create a semantic-web-site using RDFa with markdown source documents.

 * Provide a test-bed for refining the RDFa

This site uses [some content](https://sites.google.com/site/hievuws/) created by Gerry Devine, the Data Manager for the Hawkesbury institute for the Environment.
