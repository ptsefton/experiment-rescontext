title: Provenance Climate Shift experiment
typeOf: @experiment
Description: A "climate-shift" experiment using many provenances (i.e., plants of known seed origin) of two widely distributed Eucalypt species. Nine provenances of Eucalyptus grandis and 12 provenances of E. tereticornis were selected, using seed from across the eastern seaboard of Australia obtained from CSIRO. Each provenance was grown under a temperature regime approximating its home climate and at +3.5 degrees C. This experiment contains at least 3 nested projects, (1) biogeographic analysis of all provenances, (2) reciprocal transplants of a subset of provenances to quantify local adaptation, and (3) a nested drought and heatwave experiment on a subset of 2 provenances per species.
